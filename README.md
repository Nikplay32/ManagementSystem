# ManagementSystem

C# project - control system. This project was implemented in the Repl.it system. Its main idea was to create a general program to combine different functions related to sports such as soccer. This program, i can say, is a tiny database, but only with file working, which stores a lot of information that the user of the program enters into it, and also provides many other functions. In particular, the main idea was to make a soccer manager or a mini-application for all the information related to the sport.
